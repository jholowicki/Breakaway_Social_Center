# Breakaway Social Center

Breakaway is a social center on Chicago's southwest side. I made this website in collaboration with members, with an emphasis on displaying the space and featuring events. The final site ended up being hosted on Wordpress, as that was the platform members were most familiar with. This is the website in it's Jekyll incarnation, previously a content manager called Instant.cm was tried.

##Lessons Learned
